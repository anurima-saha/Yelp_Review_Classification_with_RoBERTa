# Yelp_Review_Classification_with_RoBERTa
Project begins with webscrapping Yelp reviews and rating with 'BeautifulSoup' in Python, followed by Natural Language Processing (text cleaning, removing stopwords, tokenization and lemmatization) using 'NLTK'. RoBERTa from 'HuggingFace' has been fine-tuned for text classification with early stopping and regularization using Pytorch.
